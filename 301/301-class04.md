# React and Forms

This note entry was inspired by [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-form/).

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

A controlled component is simply a component that controls form elements. It is controlled and managed by React.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

If you are using controlled you should use immediate updates. However, if you are using forms that are not controlled or want more performance than you should not.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

```Javascript
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setForm({
      ...form,
      [event.target.id]: event.target.value,
    });
  };
  ```

## Why would we use a ternary operator?

In my opinion we use it for clarity and ease of reading.

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```Javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

```Javascript
console.log(x === y ? true : false);
```
