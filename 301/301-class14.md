# Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

Based on an article by [Steve Henn](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The arise of PCs in the home.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It gives an academic advantage to be extremely comfortable with the subject matter.

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they are driven by company leaders.

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

Teams are smarter and more creative.

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

I think the example given in the [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/) is the best. A team of only right handed individuals built an app and it did not function as intended for left handed people. This shows that we have to think about ALL people in tech no matter their differences. Because at the end of the day, tech is global, tech in in everything, and tech should represent us all.
