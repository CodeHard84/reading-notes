# State and Props

## Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

As seen [here](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093) the rendering happens before the ComponentDidMount.

## What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

Mounting.

## Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

- Constructor
- Render
- ComponentDidMount
- React Updates
- ComponentWillUnmount

## What does componentDidMount do?

ComponentDidMount is called after a component is mounted.

## What types of things can you pass in the props?

Props can hold everything a JS variable can. However, they are quite different in that Props are immutable.

## What is the big difference between props and state?

Props are immutable and where state is mutable.

## When do we re-render our application?

When the state changes.

## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

Data that needs to be changed such as a counter or the thumbs up on a social media site. Data from an API, or if data needs to be filtered or sorted.
