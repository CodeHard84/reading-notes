# MongoDB and Mongoose

## Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
|-----|-------|
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | Non-relational or distributed databases |
| Table-based | Document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores |
| Predefined schema | Dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) | Uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) or similar query languages |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are a good fit for structured data where relationships between entities are important, and complex queries and transactions are required.

## Real world example:

A banking system where transactions need to be tracked, and relationships between accounts, customers, and transactions are complex and require high consistency and integrity.

## What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data, hierarchical data, and data that needs to scale out horizontally.

## Real world example:

A social media platform where user-generated content (posts, comments, likes) is stored in a flexible and scalable way to handle a large volume of data and high traffic.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases are best for hierarchical data storage as they follow the key-value pair way of storing data, similar to JSON data.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL databases are best for scalability, as they are horizontally scalable, allowing for the addition of more servers to handle large traffic and data volumes.

## What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

## What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. It typically uses tables to store data and supports the SQL language for querying.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A relational database works with tables. Each table has a clear schema, which defines the structure of the data it contains, including fields and their data types.

## What is a ‘schema’?

A schema is a clear, predefined structure of data in a table within a relational database. It defines the fields that each record must have, ensuring consistency and predictability of the data format.

## What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database is a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Examples include MongoDB and AWS DynamoDB.

## How does it work?

In a NoSQL database like MongoDB, data is stored in collections of documents, which are similar to rows in a table. These documents can have different structures and do not need to adhere to a strict schema, allowing for flexibility.

## What is inside of a MongoDB database?

Inside a MongoDB database, there are collections, and within these collections are documents. Documents are similar to JSON objects and can have varying fields and structures.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible than SQL because it does not require a predefined schema for its documents. This allows for different documents in the same collection to have different structures, making it easier to adapt to changes in data requirements.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it lacks the strict schema enforcement, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data format. Additionally, there are no built-in relations, which can complicate data management when dealing with related data across multiple collections.
