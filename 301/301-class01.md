# Component-Based Architecture & Props in React

## Component-Based Architecture

Component-based architecture is like building something using LEGO blocks. Each block (or component) is a piece of a bigger project and has a specific job or function. These blocks can connect to each other in specific ways, much like LEGO pieces snap together. Each component has its own set of rules and ways it can interact with other components—think of these like the bumps and holes on LEGO pieces that make sure they only fit together in certain ways.

This method makes it easier to handle big projects because you can break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each piece can be worked on separately and then combined with other pieces to complete the whole project. This not only helps in organizing the work better but also makes it easier to solve problems one piece at a time.

### What is a “component”?

Another simple way to think of a component is like a puzzle piece. Each component does a specific job that helps to accomplish a bigger goal when all the pieces come together.

### What are the characteristics of a component?

According to [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) the characteristics of a component are:

- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

According to [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) the advantages of component-based architecture are:

- Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

Through my research I found props are, and with help from an [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-props-in-reactjs/) by Joy O. Oluwafemi as follows:

Props, short for properties, are an essential aspect of React that enable components to communicate and share data with each other. When building applications with React, components are often designed to be reusable. To achieve this, they need to be able to work with dynamic data so that the same component can behave differently depending on the situation. This is where props come into play.

1. Passing Data: Props allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This data can include various types such as numbers, strings, functions, arrays, and even other React components. For example, if you have a parent component that holds an array of items, you can pass that array to a child component using props, and the child component can use that data to display the items.
2. Read-Only: Props are read-only. This means that a component receiving props should not modify them. Instead, any changes to the props should be handled by the parent component that owns and sets those props. This makes the data flow in your application predictable and easier to understand.
3. Customizing Components: By using props, you can customize the behavior and appearance of a component. For example, a button component might accept props for size, color, and action. You can use the same button component throughout your application but render it differently based on the props it receives, such as a large red button for an alert or a small blue button for a form submission.
4. Functional and Class Components: Props work in both functional and class components in React. In functional components, props are accessed directly from the function's parameters, while in class components, they are accessed via this.props.
Understanding and effectively using props is crucial for building efficient and maintainable React applications. They not only promote the reuse of components but also help in constructing a hierarchy of components, each possibly acting as a container for other components and passing data down the component tree.

### What is “props” short for?

Properties.

### How are props used in React?

Props are used to pass data to and from components.

### What is the flow of props?

The flow of a prop is one-way which means that data can only be passed from parent to child components, respectively. Again, credit to Joy O. Oluwafemi for their work in helping me construct this page.
