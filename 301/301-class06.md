## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is one of the key contributors to the development of the first web servers and the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specification. He conducted significant research on how the web works and his name is associated with the protocol used to transfer pages from servers to browsers.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

So anyway, HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

In addition a protocol is just a set of rules. For example treating a certain disease will have a protocol and if not, one will be established and peer reviewed. Protocols are everywhere in computing not just http.

## What does a GET do?

When you type a URL into your browser to visit a website, the browser performs an GET request. This is like telling the browser to fetch the web page you want to see. The browser asks the server for the specific resource (like a web page), and the server sends back the web page so you can view it.

## What does a POST do?

When you fill out a form on a website, like signing up for a new account, and then click the submit button, your browser sends an POST request. This request sends the data you entered (like your name and email) to the server. The server then processes this data, often creating a new record or resource based on what you submitted.

## What does PUT do?

Imagine you need to replace something that already exists with a new version. For instance, if you need to update a document you’ve already uploaded. When you use a PUT request, you're telling the server to replace the existing resource with the new data you provide. If there’s an existing item, the PUT request will overwrite it with the new information you’re sending.

## What does PATCH do?

Sometimes, you only need to update part of something that already exists, rather than replacing the whole thing. This is where a PATCH request comes in. A PATCH request tells the server to update specific parts of a resource. For example, if you only need to correct a typo in a document or change a single field in a record, a PATCH request will update just that part without replacing the entire resource.

## How I would explain this to my own brother

Alright, so imagine a website is like a huge library, and each book in that library represents some kind of information stored on the site. When you interact with the website, you're basically a visitor dealing with these books in different ways. Here’s how GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH fit into this library scenario:

GET (Grabbing a Book from the Shelf):

Using GET is like asking the librarian to fetch a specific book for you. You’re not making any changes; you just want to read the book and see what’s inside. For example, when you visit a webpage to read an article, you’re using GET to fetch that article.

POST (Adding a New Book to the Library):

Using POST is like bringing a new book to the librarian and asking them to add it to the library collection. This book didn’t exist in the library before, and now you’re creating something new. For example, when you fill out a form to sign up for a website, you’re using POST to send your information and create a new user account.

PUT (Replacing an Existing Book with a New Edition):

Using PUT is like replacing an old edition of a book with a brand new edition. You’re telling the librarian to take out the old book and put the new one in its place. The new book completely replaces the old one. For example, if you update your profile information on a website and replace all the old details with new ones, you’re using PUT.

PATCH (Updating Specific Pages in a Book):

Using PATCH is like asking the librarian to update only certain pages or sections of an existing book. Instead of replacing the entire book, you’re making changes to just a part of it. For example, if you want to change only your email address on your profile without touching the rest of your information, you’re using PATCH.

So, to sum it up:

GET is for reading an existing book.
POST is for adding a new book to the library.
PUT is for replacing an entire book with a new one.
PATCH is for updating specific parts of an existing book.
These actions help websites manage and update the information they store, making sure everything runs smoothly and you can interact with the data in different ways.

## Did you get the API keys

Yes.
