# Functional Programming

Answers for the first six entries are based on this [article](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa).

## What is functional programming?

`Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data`

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

`So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects`

## What are the benefits of a pure function?

The code is easier to test, read, and maintain.

## What is immutability?

Data that can not be changed.

## What is Referential transparency?

`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

## What is a module?

A module is a piece of code that does one specific thing. It helps keep your code organized and reusable.

## What does the word ‘require’ do?

The word require is used to load a module into your code so you can use it.

## How do we bring another module into the file we are working in?

You bring another module into your file by using the require function, like this: const myModule = require('./myModule');.

## What do we have to do to make a module available?

To make a module available, you need to export it using module.exports. For example: module.exports = myFunction;.
