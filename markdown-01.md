## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to format text documents efficiently, eliminating the need for graphical or specialized text editors like Microsoft Office. It allows for straightforward styling of text using simple, plain-text syntax.

## Why do we use Markdown?

Markdown is ingeniously crafted to ensure that plain-text files remain legible and comprehensible, even when markup tags are not processed. This design philosophy means that files marked up with Markdown are readable with any text editor, 
providing a universal way to view and edit content. Employed across diverse platforms, from emails to books, and integral to the creation of web pages like this one, Markdown's simplicity doesn't sacrifice power or aesthetics. It facilitates the swift 
production of elegant web content, liberating users from the intricacies of HTML. In essence, Markdown is the bridge between easy-to-read text and beautifully formatted digital content, making it a preferred choice for seamless and efficient writing and editing.

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

The `#` symbol will create a heading in Markdown. It is important to know that there are six supported levels of headings in Markdown.

### How many do you need to create the largest heading?

Level 1 headings or the *largest* heading is constructed by using one `#` symbol followed by your desired heading.

For example:
`# This is the LARGEST heading`

### How many do you need to create the smallest heading?

The smallest heading in Markdown is achieved by using six `#` symbols.

For example:
`###### This is the smallest heading`

## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

When creating **bold** text it is best practice to use the `*` symbol, especially if the word is between other words.

For example:
`I **wish** I had a Coke Zero right now.` 

Which appears as: I **wish** I had a Coke Zero right now.

When creating *italicized* text it is best practice to use the `*` symbol, especially if the word is between other words.

For example:
`Markdown files are editable in *virtually* any text editor.` 

Which appears as: Markdown files are editable in *virtually* any text editor.

## How do you create a link with Markdown?

Links are created in markdown using a combination of brackets.

For example:
`Click [here](https://github.com/CodeHard84) to see my profile!`

Which appears as:

Click [here](https://github.com/CodeHard84) to see my profile!


## What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

To create an unordered bulleted list in Markdown you can use the following three symbols:

`-` `*` `+`

For example:
`###### My grocery list:`

`- eggs`

`* milk`

`+ cheese`

`- darth vader or ewok crisp cereal`

Which appears as:

###### My grocery list:
- eggs
* milk
+ cheese
- darth vader or ewok crisp cereal

**Important:** Although you can use multiple symbols in the same list. It is best practice to use a consistent style such as all `*` or `+` symbols and not to mix and match.
