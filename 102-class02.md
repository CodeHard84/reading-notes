# The Aspiring Coder

Here is a concise guide to introduce you to the fundamentals of command line navigation and a selection of coding tools. With the vast array of coding utilities available, developers have the flexibility to choose tools that best align with their preferences and project requirements. This guide aims to provide a foundational understanding to help you make informed choices in your coding journey.

## Text Editors vs code-specific editors vs IDEs

Understanding the distinct features and functionalities of text editors, code-specific editors, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is crucial in choosing the right tools for your coding tasks. This knowledge allows you to select the most suitable application based on the complexity of your project, your coding efficiency, and the level of support you require, ensuring a streamlined and effective development process.

### Text Editors

Text editors, true to their name, are applications primarily designed for editing text. Their complexity varies widely, from the simplicity of programs like Notepad to the comprehensive feature set of applications like Microsoft Office. While these tools can indeed be used for coding, they lack specialized functionalities tailored to programming, which can be a drawback for their use in more technical or code-intensive tasks.

### Code-Specific Editors

Code-specific editors build upon the foundational capabilities of text editors by incorporating additional features that streamline and enhance the coding experience. These enhancements include syntax highlighting, code completion, and customizable support for various programming languages. While retaining the lightweight nature of traditional text editors, code-specific editors offer a more efficient and tailored environment for coding without the comprehensive complexity of a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### IDEs

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a comprehensive suite designed for software development. These robust tools are the most feature-rich of the editors discussed, offering extensive capabilities beyond simple editing. While they are heavier in terms of system resources, their specialization in certain programming languages or platforms enables them to provide superior support and functionality tailored to specific development needs, making them an invaluable asset for more complex projects.

### Necessary Editor Features

According to *The Older Coder* whom wrote a very detailed article about this subject a text editor needs these four essential funtions listed in paraphrase.

1. Code Completion
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. Vartiety of Themes
4. An extensive selection of extensions

While I appreciate the comprehensive nature of the items on the list as a guideline for choosing an ideal editor, I'm not entirely convinced of its necessity, particularly the emphasis on multiple themes. This stipulation might overlook the intrinsic value of shell based, yet highly effective editors like VIM, Nano, or Pico, which excel in functionality without the need for extensive thematic customization. As a result, this list serves as a strong starting point, but one should consider the unique merits of each editor beyond just thematic versatility.

### Summary

Regardless of your choice, ranging from a straightforward text editor to a feature-dense Integrated Development Environment (IDE), having some form of editor is essential for coding. Programmers have a wide array of options when it comes to selecting an editor, and as you gain experience, you'll naturally discover the preferences that suit your workflow and project needs best. The journey to finding the right tools is as much a part of programming as the coding itself.

### Command Line

The command line is as indispensable to a coder as an editor, serving as a powerful interface for executing commands ranging from the simple to the complex. This section of the guide will focus on fundamental commands applicable across Linux, Mac, and Windows (via WSL) terminals. It's designed to familiarize you with the basic yet essential directives that form the foundation of more advanced computer interactions.

We will cover five basic commands:

1. `pwd` this command prints the current working directory.
2. `ls` this command prints the contents of the current working directory.
3. `cd` this command allows one to traverse directories.
4. `mkdir` this command creates a new directory.
5. `touch` this command creates a new empty file.

Given the following scenario: a user executes the below commands in the terminal, what is the expected results?

`cd projects`

`mkdir new-project`

`touch new-project/newfile.md`

`cd ..`

`ls projects/new-project`

The commands issued above will change to the projects folder, create a new folder called new-project, create a new file called newfile.md in the new-project directory, then the working directory will return the user to the directory which holds the projects folder, finally the last command will list the contents of the new-project folder.
