# Reading Notes (a journal of sorts)

While I am uncertain of the exact direction my journal will take as I advance in my studies, I am very enthusiastic about embarking on this new journey in coding.

## A Short Introduction ðŸ˜Ž

![Jace's Avatar](assets/pic.png)

Greetings! My name is Jace. As of December 30, 2023, I've embarked on an exciting journey to master modern coding techniques. I'm eager to contribute meaningfully to the industry soon and make a positive impact with my newfound skills. To learn more about my projects and progress, feel free to visit my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/CodeHard84).

## Growth Mindset

The growth mindset challenges the old adage "You can't teach an old dog new tricks," embodying the belief that we can evolve and expand our capabilities throughout our lives. Every day, in various aspects of our lives, we encounter opportunities for growth, learning, and adaptation. Embracing the growth mindset means acknowledging and embracing the constant changes in our world, committing to lifelong learning, and continuously striving to add value in our endeavors. It's about fostering resilience, nurturing a positive outlook towards challenges, and steadfastly refusing to doubt our potential or capabilities. This mindset isn't just about personal development; it's a transformative approach that encourages us to see beyond limitations, embrace change, and persistently pursue excellence and improvement in all we do.

## I will maintain a growth mindset by adhering to the following principles

- Recognizing that abilities I lack today can be developed and mastered in the future through perseverance and effort.
- Committing to learning something new every day, thereby continuously expanding my knowledge and skills.
- Constantly refining and improving my abilities by embracing innovative and more efficient methods, and dedicating myself to regular practice and application. This approach ensures that I am always evolving and adapting, ready to meet new challenges and opportunities with confidence and skill.
