# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental web technology that empowers designers and developers to exert precise control over the appearance of their web pages. By defining rules and styles, CSS transforms websites into visually appealing, user-friendly, and highly customizable digital experiences, ensuring consistency and enhancing the overall user interface.

## What is the purpose of CSS?

Imagine a website as a house under construction: HTML forms the sturdy framework, while CSS serves as the finishing touch. CSS elevates your HTML-structured pages by adding the essential elements of style and aesthetics, enhancing their visual appeal and user experience.

## What are the three ways to use CSS in a project?

1. External which includes a CSS source file in the HTML.
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
2. Internal which is just CSS in the HTML document itself.
3. Inline which provides styling directly in the HTML element.
`<p style="color: black;">`

## Misc
To turn all the paragraph element text red you could:
`p { color: red; }`
