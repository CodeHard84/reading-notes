# Git Version Control

Among the array of version control systems available, Git stands out as a leading choice for many developers. My introduction to Git, and subsequently GitHub, came through my training as a Code Fellow, where its importance and utility were emphasized. Below are a few brief insights into Git. For those seeking a deeper dive into its capabilities and usage, I recommend exploring this comprehensive [guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/). This resource offers extensive information suitable for both beginners and seasoned users alike.

## What is Version Control

Version control is a systematic method of tracking and managing changes to files and documents. It facilitates collaboration among multiple developers on a single project, allows for the reversion of code to a previous state in case of errors, supports non-linear development strategies, and more. Think of version control as a photography system for your code, capturing snapshots at various stages of development, enabling you to view its evolution over time and revert to earlier versions when necessary.

I will provide you with some tips about the most basic Git commands. Again, please see the link above for a more comprehensive guide.

### Cloning

`git clone` is the command used to clone an existing repository to where you specify on your computer.

### Add

`git add` is the command that adds files in a project to the git repository. This enables git to track and stage files.

### Commit

`git commit` is the command that creates a snapshot of your staged and tracked files.

### Push

`git push` is the command that will send your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.
