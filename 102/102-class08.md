# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

According to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. It is worth noting that all complex expressions are joined by operators.

## Why use a loop?

Using loops can solve complex problems in a simpler manner than nested `if` statements.

## For Loop

A for loop will execute a given amount of times until exhausted. For example:

```Javascript
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

In the above given example the loop will execute 10 times then terminate.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

A `while` loop will execute until the given condition is no longer true.

```Javascript
let imCold = true;
while (imCold) {
    turnUpHeat();
}
```

The above code is an infinite loop. It will execute because imCold will always evaluate to true in this case.
