# Images, Color, Text, and More Work With Functions

## What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

A real world example of what to use an alt attribute would be to use it on an `<img>` element. This helps with *several* things.

* Accessability (Such as screen readers).
* Providing a description if the image does not load.
* Providing information that has SEO value, such as what's in the image?

## How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

Use an `alt` attribute!

## Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document

Figure elements provide semantic value to images. It relates a caption to an image directly. An example of this would be an image of someone and a caption of who they are:

```Javascript
<figure>

<img src="jace-is-awesome.jpg" 
alt="a picture of Jace though his image shattered the camera, he is still awesome." />

<figcaption>A rare sighting of Jace in the wild.</figcaption>

</figure>

```

By containing the above in a clear container it improves SEO, accessability, and provides value beyond just a `<p>` tag.

## Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community

You would use a gif for a simple photo or an animation of several simple photos, like flipping an pages through a flipbook. You would use an svg image for when you need precise sizing such as for usable items on a webpage like a button.

## What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

I would use a PNG because it is lossless and that's what [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format) told me to do.
