# Layout with CSS

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

It is made for the viewport of the browser. It takes your elements and gives the best layout with out hard constraints. [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

The main axis can be thought as left to right and the cross axis top to bottom.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Reversing the columns and rows can have negative results as they change the tab order from what is presented in the document object manager (dom).

## What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) the advantages to flexbox over float is it is easier to:

1. Vertically center a block.
2. Making all the children take up an equal amount of available space.
3. Making all the columns in a multi-column layout the same height, despite the content.

## How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

I think Flexbox will help me wireframe and knock out prototypes. But I see myself more as a backend coder than a designer.
