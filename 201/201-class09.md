# Forms and JS Events

## Why are forms so important in web development?

It is the main form of user communication with the web site.

## When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Keep it simple and on topic to not frustrate the user.

## List 5 form elements and explain their importance

1. The `form` element defines the area of the form.
2. `label` used to label input boxes.
3. `input` this element tells the browser we are expecting input.
4. `textarea` defines an input field.
5. `button` this is used to submit a form.

## How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events happen as a user interacts with a website. Such as clicking a button or submitting a form.

## When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

A string indicating what event to listen and a call to a function.

## Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

The event object is a collection of things passed to javascript. The target property is a pointer to the element in which the event occured. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

## What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event bubbling is when the event "bubbles up" which essentially provides the elements from children up to parent. This works nearly the same as event bubbling except in reverse order.
